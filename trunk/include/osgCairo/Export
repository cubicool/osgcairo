//! \section intro Introduction
//!
//! osgCairo is C++ glueware between the excellent <a href='http://cairographics.org'>Cairo C library</a>
//! and the <a href='http://openscenegraph.org'>OpenSceneGraph</a>. If you are viewing this documentation
//! then you are likely quite familar with OSG, but are new to Cairo.
//! 
//! \section about What Is Cairo
//!
//! Cairo is a 2D vector drawing library that enjoys widespread use in the Linux world. It is
//! a exceptionally well-designed piece of software that will compile and run on many platforms,
//! and serves as a very competitive (if not superior) free alternative to other kinds of
//! software that attempt to do the same thing.
//!
//! The author of this software originally intended to use Cairo simply for interactively
//! generating user interface elements at runtime, but it soon became evident that Cairo was
//! capable of helping with much more. For example, using a routine found in the ReadFile
//! header, osgCairo can load any image that OSG itself supports and use the contents of that
//! image as a background for future drawing operations. Furthermore, Cairo provides a
//! glyph object that when used properly (with software like Pango/osgPango) can paint very
//! high-quality font faces.
//!
//! \section usage A Quick Example
