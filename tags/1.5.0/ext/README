This is a directory containing different (though so far, just one) svn:external
projects to be used in osgCairo.

cairocks/
	This is a utility library (also written by myself) providing a number
	interesting Cairo utility functions. I use these functions in so many
	different environments that I decided it belonged in its own project.

	Hopefully, other Cairo people will contribute to it and, thus, so
	shall osgCairo indirecty benefit.
